I'm trying things out on the seasons theme so I decided to use git to try and roll back any major errors. While doing that I figured why not back it up to github?'

Hopefully this will make it easy(ish) to diff between my altered theme and the original so that I can observe [and explain] all changes.

I will also list other changes I have made to the installed packages here so that I have a record of them for upgrading / moving server.
